# How to run specified tests only

When you have a large test suite with a lot of specs, in the development process, you may want to run the onces you are developing only for efficiency. 

You can do this very easily. All you have to do is to use `fdescribe` or `fit`, where `f` stand for "force". If you have any forced tests in your suite, Jasmine will only run the forced tests and ignore all other tests.

Remember to remove `f` after once you are done with the test. It works with any test runner.

# How to ignore specified tests
